		<h1>Talking trash</h1>
		<br>
		<p id="intro">Advocates on either side of the roll cart issue have been outspoken about the opinions.
			Former City Manager John Glascock <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/elections/ballot-issue-on-roll-carts-approaches-how-did-we-get-here/article_0fffd15a-e43a-11e5-9add-af73f2a15ea0.html">once told the Missourian,</a>
			"...If you really want to see people get upset, just mess with their trash."
			The Columbia Missourian has covered the issue of Columbia's trash system for years, talking to people on both sides of the debate about why they
			do or do not want roll carts and how the trash system impacts their lives.
			Hear some people's thoughts cited in previous Missourian reporting throughout the years.</p>
