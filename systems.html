		<h1>The Columbia Trash System</h1>
	<br>
		<p style="margin 0em 40em 0em 0em;">The idea of roll carts are new to Columbia, but cities and towns across the nation use them regularly.
			<br>Take a look at the trash systems in Columbia and beyond.

There is a warning that the trash bag should be used for household trash only and no hazardous waste. This is a photo of the trash bags residents are expected to use." class="image-align-right">

		<h3>Pay-as-you-throw system</h3>
		<p style="margin-right: 65%">
			For curbside trash to be picked up by the City of Columbia, it must be in the trash bags provided by the City. <br>Residents can redeem vouchers at select locations around Columbia. <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/bags-for-columbias-pay-as-you-throw-program-available-tuesday/article_370ebc5e-28db-5d53-8aff-d9abeb76b927.html">There is a limit of 104 bags per year</a>, or 2 per week. Residents can purchase more bags if needed.

		<h3>Curbside pickup</h3>
		<p style="padding-right: 50px">
			If Columbia residents have large items they wish to dispose of, they must complete a request form online and pay extra for the service.

		<h3>Dumpsters</h3>
		<p>For residents who do not receive curbside collection -- typically those living in apartment complexes -- there are usually dumpsters nearby. These do not require the City-provided trash bags.

		<h3>Roll carts</h3>
		<p style="padding-right: 40px">In other places, people place their trash bags into roll carts they leave at the curb.
