		<h1>A city divided â€” about trash</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Columbia, Missouri, just can't seem to make up its mind about trash. Many residents have strong opinions on how their garbage should be collected. And the issue didn't die out after a failed vote for roll carts in 2016; voters will once again weigh in on the issue of waste management this August.
			<br>The Missourian has assembled a comprehensive guide to trash in Columbia. Browse this website to learn about the various proposed systems for trash collection, a timeline of the trash debate, and a talk with some outspoken voices on the issue.
